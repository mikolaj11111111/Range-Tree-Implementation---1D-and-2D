# Range Tree Implementation - 1D and 2D

A comprehensive implementation of Range Tree data structures for efficient range queries in 1D and 2D spaces, with performance analysis and visualization tools.

## Description

This project implements Range Tree data structures from scratch for both 1D and 2D cases. Range trees are balanced binary search trees that enable efficient range queries - finding all points within a specified range in logarithmic time.

The implementation provides:
- **1D Range Tree** - for queries on a single dimension
- **2D Range Tree** - for rectangular range queries in 2D space  
- **Performance benchmarking** - time and memory usage analysis
- **Interactive visualization** - graphical representation of query results
- **Scalability testing** - analysis across different dataset sizes

The project demonstrates the theoretical time complexities:
- **1D Range Tree**: O(log n + k) query time, O(n) space
- **2D Range Tree**: O(log¬≤ n + k) query time, O(n log n) space

Where n is the number of points and k is the number of points in the result.
